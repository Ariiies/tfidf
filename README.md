In information retrieval, tf–idf (also TF*IDF, TFIDF, TF–IDF, or Tf–idf), short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, 
is a measure of importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus, adjusted for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.
Like the bag-of-words model, it models a document as a multiset of words, without word order.
It is a refinement over the simple bag-of-words model, by allowing the weight of words to depend on the rest of the corpus. (From Wiki)
