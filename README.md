## TF-IDF ##

In information retrieval, tf–idf (also TF*IDF, TFIDF, TF–IDF, or Tf–idf), short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, 
is a measure of importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus, adjusted for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.
Like the bag-of-words model, it models a document as a multiset of words, without word order.
It is a refinement over the simple bag-of-words model, by allowing the weight of words to depend on the rest of the corpus. 

This project can be used in others like projects of machine learning, sentiment analysis or like seachers based on smilitud by cosene.
For proper funtionating of this project is neeeded another one called [Corpy](https://www.github.com/Ariiies/corpy) and numpy too.
